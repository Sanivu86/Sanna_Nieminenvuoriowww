<h1> What is the difference between html and html 5? </h1>

<p> The difference between html and html5 is that in html5 it has been replaced more scripting with markups, so it is more simply to create web-pages. 
    So in simply way to say it in html5 there is more tags to use, for example video-tag. So linking a video to your web-page is super easy. Also in html5 web-pages can store data localy, so it is faster and safer.
For users the main benefits are better looks in the web-pages and you can use the web-page without Internet connection.  </p>

        <img src="images/Monni.jpg" alt="Kissan kuva" height="250px" style="display: block; float: right;"/> <br>
        <figcaption>  This is my cute cat, Monni.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    To apply the finnish characters, I put in the head meta-tag, which gets the charset UTF-8. <br>

<h3>What did I do in this excercise?</h3>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
 In this exercise I made a new css-file, to control, all elements inside the body, fontsize and fontstyle. I also applied a new backgroundcolor to the whole page. I added a video and some links. I was a little bit naughty and didn't change the h1 fontsize to 16px, but 40px. I also made a bottom border for the h1 and changed the color. Links have hovers and image is in the paragraph and has a caption.
