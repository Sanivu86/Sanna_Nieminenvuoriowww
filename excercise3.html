<h1> What is the difference between html and html 5? </h1>

<p> The difference between html and html5 is that in html5 it has been replaced more scripting with markups, so it is more simply to create web-pages. 
    So in simply way to say it in html5 there is more tags to use, for example video-tag. So linking a video to your web-page is super easy. Also in html5 web-pages can store data localy, so it is faster and safer.
For users the main benefits are better looks in the web-pages and you can use the web-page without Internet connection.  </p>
